Content:

A loan application is used by borrowers to apply for a loan. Through the loan application, borrowers reveal key details about their finances to the lender. The loan application is crucial to determining whether the lender will grant the request for funds or credit.

Problem Statement:

Bank identified that going through the loan applications to filter the people who can be granted loans or need to be rejected is a tedious and time-consuming process. If this process can be automated, this will increase bankâ€™s efficiency as well as transparency and a better decision.

Objective:

The idea behind this ML project is to build an ML model and web application that the bank can use to classify if a user can be granted a loan or not.

Evaluation Criteria:
